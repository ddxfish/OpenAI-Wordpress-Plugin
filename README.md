# OpenAI-Wordpress-Plugin
Allows use of the OpenAI in Wordpress. Shortcodes display text prompt or image prompt. It's called chatGPT in the settings but it uses Davinci right now, which is not chatGPT, but rather a version of GPT-3. 

# Disclaimer

This uses your API key which costs money. Do not make this public on your Wordpress site.
